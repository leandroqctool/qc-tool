## üîß **ENGINEERING RULES & BEST PRACTICES**

### **Database Usage**
- Use Drizzle ORM for standard CRUD operations
- Cast Neon results instead of using generics: `(await sql\`...\`) as unknown as RowType[]`
- Prefer IPv4 DNS: `dns.setDefaultResultOrder('ipv4first')`
- Use unpooled connections for auth: `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED`
- Keep queries simple; avoid long transactions

### **API Routes & RSC**
- Use absolute URLs for internal API calls from Server Components
- Build URLs from `headers()`: `const proto = headers().get('x-forwarded-proto') || 'http'`
- Implement centralized error handling with consistent JSON responses
- Apply rate limiting for sensitive endpoints

### **Cloudflare R2**
- Use correct host style: account host requires `forcePathStyle: true`
- Exclude checksum headers from presigned URL signatures
- Use `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD` for browser uploads
- Ensure CORS includes all necessary methods and headers

### **TypeScript & Linting**
- No `any` types or unused imports/variables
- Avoid `@ts-ignore` - use narrow type assertions
- Use relative imports only (no @/ path aliases)
- Run `npm run build` before commits

### **Security**
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Implement proper session management
- Add security headers in middleware
- Use HTTPS only in production
- Implement audit logging for sensitive actions
